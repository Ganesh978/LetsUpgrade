		The ways we can access elements in the DOM<br>
      <strong>Way-1(id)
      <h2>const name = document.getElementById("name");</h2>
      console.log(name);
        When we should access any HTML element using the method called getElementById(), 
      An ID must always be unique to the page,and therefore we will only ever be able to access 
      a single element at a time with the getElementById() method. <br> 
      

      <strong><h3>Way-2(Accessing Elements by Class)</h3>
      <h2>const main = document.getElementsByClassName("main");</h2>
      console.log(main);
       The class attribute is used to access one or more specific elements in the DOM.
       So this we need to linked class attribute with value with that element which we would to access.
       This  getElementsByClassName() method return all the elements with a given class name 
        (a collection (an array) of HTML elements)
        Here , We can perform array operation and properties for manipulation. <br>

      <strong><h3>Way-3(Accessing Elements by Tag)</h3>

      <h2>const tagname = document.getElementsByTagName("h3");</h2>
      console.log(tagname);
      We can uses this approach to get all the html elements having same html tag name , Hence it returns 
       collection (an array) of HTML elements .So here we can also perform array operation and properties for manipulation<br>

      <strong><h3>Way-4(Accessing Elements by Query Selectors.)</h3>
      <h2>const demo1query = document.querySelector(".demo1");</h2>
      console.log(demo1query);
 
      To access a single element, we will use the querySelector() method , on basis of argument .
      Argument would be Id or class name (with their access sign (id-># , class-> . ))linked with HTML element 
       querySelector() returns a single object with the first HTML element that matches the 'selectors'
      const demo2query = document.querySelectorAll(".demo2");
      console.log(demo2query);
